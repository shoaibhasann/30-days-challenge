This project is a social media application inspired by Instagram, created using pure Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It mimics several key features of Instagram, including user authentication, post management, real-time notifications, and a UI inspired by Instagram's dark theme. The application is a Single Page Application (SPA) that dynamically renders content, providing a seamless and responsive experience across all device sizes.

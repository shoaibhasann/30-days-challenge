# Shoppie Ecommerce Website

Shoppie is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA), ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. The website dynamically renders pages using JavaScript, meaning that when users navigate between different sections—such as the product listings, cart, checkout, and order confirmation—only the relevant content is updated without reloading the entire page. This approach provides faster interactions and a more fluid experience, making the website feel more responsive and intuitive. Each page transition is handled efficiently, ensuring that users can shop, review their cart, and complete their purchase with minimal interruption.
